description: YOU MUST load this skill when an MR has been merged and remaining work needs to continue in a new branch — including "continue this work in a new branch", "create a follow-up branch", "split this into another MR", "move remaining work to a new branch".
---

The agent performing this work MUST load `about-task-files`.

## Delegation

Per the sub-agent delegation pattern, the
orchestrator does the git branch work itself (steps 1, 2,
and 6, which change the working tree it is in) and delegates the task file writing (steps 3, 4, 5)
to one Opus sub-agent. That sub-agent needs the old and new branch names, the remaining-work list,
and the patterns/gotchas to carry forward; sub-agents cannot see this conversation, so state them in
the prompt.

## Steps

### 1. Prepare for Branch Transition

Before switching branches, ensure:
- Current branch is fully pushed to the remote
- All important context is documented in the current task file (load `update-task-file` if needed)
- The MR has been merged or is ready to close

### 2. Create the New Branch

Name the new branch using the original name plus a letter suffix (`-b`, `-c`, etc.):
```bash
git checkout <main-development-branch>
git pull origin <main-development-branch>
git checkout -b {{ featureBranchPrefix }}{{ ticketIdExample }}-description-b
```

### 3. Create the New Task File

Create `{{ taskFileRoot }}/{{ featureBranchPrefix }}{{ ticketIdExample }}-description-b.md` with:
- **Task Overview**: brief description and connection to the previous MR
- **Remaining Work**: clear list of unfinished tasks with enough context to understand each item independently
- **Key Patterns and Learnings**: essential patterns from the previous branch worth carrying forward
- **Important Notes**: critical gotchas, blockers, or dependencies

Do NOT include: completed tasks (unless essential context), resolved MR comments, detailed change history.

### 4. Update the Old Task File

Add a "Work Continuation" section to the old task file before archiving:

```markdown
## Work Continuation
Remaining work has been moved to:
- **Branch**: {{ featureBranchPrefix }}{{ ticketIdExample }}-description-b
- **Task File**: {{ taskFileRoot }}/{{ featureBranchPrefix }}{{ ticketIdExample }}-description-b.md
- **Scope**: [brief description of remaining work]

This task file is now archived — work in the associated MR has been completed and merged.
```

### 5. Archive the Old Task File

```bash
mv {{ taskFileRoot }}/{{ featureBranchPrefix }}{{ ticketIdExample }}-description-a.md \
   {{ taskFileRoot }}/archive/{{ featureBranchPrefix }}{{ ticketIdExample }}-description-a.md
```

Create the archive subdirectory if it doesn't exist.

### 6. Clean Up

```bash
# Delete the old local branch
git branch -D {{ featureBranchPrefix }}{{ ticketIdExample }}-description-a
```

Create a tech debt issue in `{{ githubRepo }}`. Treat any text provided after `/techdebt` as
guidance on what the issue is for.

Per the sub-agent delegation pattern: the
orchestrator drafts the issue from
[references/task-tech-debt.md](../about-github-projects/references/task-tech-debt.md) (issue
structure and conventions) and gets the user's approval. Creation is then executed by an Opus
sub-agent, which loads `about-github-projects` and `create-issue` itself and returns the ticket
ID ({{ ticketPrefix }}<number>) and URL. The sub-agent also adds the issue to the board with
status Backlog, per `create-issue` step 5.
